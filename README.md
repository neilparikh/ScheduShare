ScheduShare
===========

An web app that allows event organizers communicate with attendees. Built for HackTheNorth 2014.

## How it works

1. An event organizer creates an itinerary, and populates it with their events. They receive a unique code which they share with the attendees.
2. The attendees text this code to ScheduShareâ€™s phone number (hosted by Twilio). The number responds with the itinerary created the organizer in step 1.
3. The organizer decides to broadcast a notification to everyone. All attendees who sent a text in step 2 will recieve broadcast.
